MissingOutputException in rule sketch_genomes in file /Users/matthewfunk/snakemake_tutorial/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
GCF_000017335.1.fna.gz.sig (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Removing output files of failed job sketch_genomes since they might be corrupted:
GCF_000020225.1.fna.gz.sig, GCF_000021665.1.fna.gz.sig
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
